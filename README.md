# Project Overview
Our project examined electric vehicles registered in Washington State from years 1997 through 2025.

Our group focused on the visualization track and our deliverable is an interactive dashboard focused on demonstrating:
- Aggregate information about the cars registered by make and model
- Trends among cars registered through years 2010-2024 and prediction model for years 2025-2030
