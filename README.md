# Project 3: Electric Vehicle Trends in Washington State
Group Members: Angelica Sandel, Mamadou Diallo, Matthew Durney, TJ Giles and Victor Doan

# Project Overview
Our project examined electric vehicles registered in Washington State from years 1997 through 2025.

Our group focused on the visualization track and our deliverable is an interactive dashboard focused on demonstrating:
- Aggregate information about the cars registered by make and model
- Trends among cars registered through years 2010-2024 and prediction model for years 2025-2030
- Locations of cars registered throughout the state

The dashboard will allow users to make informed decisions on which electric cars are most popular, aggregate snapshot about the make and which areas most cars are registered.

# Website Features and Usage
- Users can select a car make or car model from the drop-down menu located at the upper left hand corner of the webpage. Once a selection is made users are able to view:
    - Aggregrate car informormation on the card below the drop down menu
    - Top 20 cars by model bar chart
    - Distribution of car make pie chart, the selected car make will be highlighted
    - Mouseover tooltips are avaible for the bar and pie chart to provide additional metric for each category
- Users are able to view total cars from 2010 and prediction of cars from years 2025 through 2030 by viewing the line chart. Mouseover tooltip is available to show data.
- Users are able to zoom in and zoom out to explore location and density of registered cars throughout Washington state in the geo graph

# Ethical Considerations
The dataset used in this project was sourced from data.gov on electric vehicle population data. A CSV housed the original data and contained various columns including the VIN id's. We wanted to ensure data privacy was maintained and we did not display any personal identificable information and we did not misuse having access to the VIN id's to track or identify car owners. Further, we ensured responsible handling and storage of the data to help protect breaches of privacy.

We also ensured our visulizations were not biased and were fair by including all make and models and not intentinally ommitting certain make or models. Further, we included all regions of Washington state and did not omit or exclude any areas to ensure fairness.
